  -- Outstanding Leadership - emotional intelligence makes better leaders

* Happiness is a skill that can be trained.
* Emotional intelligence is trainable, even in adults. This claim is based on a fairly new branch of science known as “neuroplasticity.”  One very important implication of neuroplasticity is that we can intentionally change our brains with training.

We begin by training attention.
--“Between stimulus and response, there is a space. In that space lies our freedom and our power to choose our response."
Train at the level of Physiology.
--Essentially, because emotion has such a strong physiological component, we cannot develop emotional intelligence unless we operate at the level of physiology. That is why we direct our mindfulness there.

*  Meet your inner critics (video)
Watched video and it's interesting to see a video that explains how our thoughts over years of influence from others can generate negative thinking.

*  Learn about privilege
I was always taught that if you were born to privilege then comes the responsibility of caring for others that haven't that same privilege.
